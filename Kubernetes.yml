What is Kubernetes :
    Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It uses a cluster of machines, with each machine running one or more containers, and a set of control plane components that orchestrate the deployment and management of these containers.
    Kubernetes is based on the concept of "pods" which are the smallest deployable units in the system. Pods contain one or more containers, and they share the same network and storage resources. Pods are created and managed by higher-level abstractions, such as "Replication Controllers" and "Services".
    Replication Controllers ensure that a specified number of replicas of a pod are running at any given time. If a pod fails, a Replication Controller will create a new one to replace it. Services provide a stable network endpoint for pods, allowing them to communicate with each other, and with external systems.
    The control plane components in Kubernetes, such as the API server, scheduler, and controller manager, communicate with each other to orchestrate the deployment, scaling, and management of pods. The API server is the central management component, responsible for storing the desired state of the system, and serving this state to other components. The scheduler is responsible for deciding which nodes in the cluster should run a given pod. The controller manager is responsible for reconciling the actual state of the system with the desired state, and making necessary changes to bring them into alignment.
    Kubernetes provides various tools for networking, such as "network plugins" that allow pods to communicate with each other, and "ingress controllers" that manage inbound network traffic to the cluster. It also provides features for storage management, such as "persistent volumes" and "volume plugins", which allow pods to access and store data.
    In terms of security, Kubernetes provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as tools for network segmentation, such as network policies. It also provides features for securing sensitive data, such as secrets and certificates, which can be stored in a secure manner and accessed by pods as needed.
    Kubernetes also offers extensibility through the use of "custom resources" and "operators", allowing users to extend its capabilities and integrate with other systems.
    Overall, Kubernetes provides a powerful platform for deploying and managing containerized applications, with a rich set of features for networking, storage, security, and extensibility.
    
Kubernetes Architecture :
    Kubernetes architecture consists of a cluster of nodes, a set of control plane components, and a distributed storage system.
    Nodes: The nodes in the cluster are the machines that run the containers. They can be physical machines or virtual machines running in a cloud environment. Each node runs a container runtime, such as Docker, to manage containers, and an agent called the "kubelet", which communicates with the control plane components.
    Control Plane: The control plane components are responsible for the orchestration of the deployment, scaling, and management of containers. The main components of the control plane are:
    API Server: The API server is the central management component, responsible for storing the desired state of the system, and serving this state to other components. It implements the Kubernetes API and serves as the single source of truth for the state of the system.
    Scheduler: The scheduler is responsible for deciding which nodes in the cluster should run a given pod. It takes into account factors such as resource utilization, constraints, and node availability, to determine the best node for a pod to run on.
    Controller Manager: The controller manager is responsible for reconciling the actual state of the system with the desired state, and making necessary changes to bring them into alignment. It implements a number of controllers, such as the Replication Controller, which ensures that a specified number of replicas of a pod are running at any given time.
    etcd: etcd is a distributed key-value store that serves as the backing store for the state of the system. The API server stores the desired state of the system in etcd, and other components, such as the scheduler and controller manager, read from etcd to determine the current state of the system.
    Distributed Storage: Kubernetes provides various tools for storage management, such as "persistent volumes" and "volume plugins". Persistent volumes allow pods to access and store data, and they can be dynamically provisioned by the system. Volume plugins allow different types of storage, such as network-attached storage or cloud-based storage, to be used with Kubernetes.
    In summary, the Kubernetes architecture consists of a cluster of nodes, a set of control plane components, and a distributed storage system, working together to provide a platform for deploying and managing containerized applications.

Basic setup of a kubernetes cluster :
    Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to configure a Kubernetes cluster using the kubeadm tool and the commands to use:
    Install Docker and Kubernetes tools: 
        Install Docker and the necessary Kubernetes tools, kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl, on all nodes. On a Ubuntu machine, you can use the following commands to install these packages:
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
            sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
    Initialize the master node: 
        On the master node, run the following command to initialize the cluster:
            sudo kubeadm init : This command generates the necessary certificates and sets up the cluster.
    Join worker nodes: 
        After initializing the master node, you can join worker nodes to the cluster using the following command:
            sudo kubeadm join <master-node-ip>:<port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
            Replace <master-node-ip>, <port>, <token>, and <hash> with the appropriate values, which can be found in the output of the kubeadm init command.
    Configure networking: 
        To allow Pods to communicate with each other and with the outside world, you need to configure a network overlay. You can choose from several networking solutions, including Calico, Flannel, and Weave Net. 
        To install Calico, you can use the following command:
            kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
    Deploy add-ons: 
        Kubernetes provides several add-ons that can be used to provide additional functionality to the cluster, such as the Kubernetes Dashboard and DNS. 
            To deploy the Kubernetes Dashboard, you can use the following command:    
                kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0-beta8/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
    Enable and configure a load balancer: 
        To expose your services to the outside world, you need to configure a load balancer. You can use a cloud-provided load balancer, such as an AWS ELB, or a Kubernetes-native solution like MetalLB. 
            To set up MetalLB, you can use the following commands:
                kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.9.3/manifests/namespace.yaml
                kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.9.3/manifests/metallb.yaml
    Configure automatic scaling: 
        To automatically scale your applications based on resource usage, you can use the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). 
            To set up the HPA, you can use the following command:
                kubectl autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --min=2 --max=10 --cpu-percent=80
    Secure secret management: 
        To securely manage secrets in your cluster, you can use Kubernetes Secrets. 
            To create a Secret, you can use the following command:
                kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=<key>=<value>
    Configure network policies: 
        To control network traffic within your cluster, you can use Kubernetes Network Policies. 
            To create a Network Policy, you can use the following command:
                kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
                Where network-policy.yaml is a file containing the definition of the Network Policy you want to create.
    Verify the cluster: 
        To verify that the cluster is running correctly, you can use the following command:     
            kubectl get nodes : This command should show the status of all nodes in the cluster.
 
 
The main sections of Kubernetes Manifest Files :
    A Kubernetes manifest file is a YAML or JSON file that defines the desired state of a Kubernetes object, such as a Pod, Service, or Deployment. A manifest file specifies the properties and configuration of the object.
    A typical Kubernetes manifest file contains the following sections:
        API version: The API version of the Kubernetes object being defined, such as "v1" for Pods or "apps/v1" for Deployments.
        Kind: The type of Kubernetes object being defined, such as "Pod", "Service", or "Deployment".
        Metadata: Information that describes the object, such as its name, labels, and annotations.
        Spec: The specification of the object, including its properties, configuration, and desired state. For example, the spec section of a Deployment might include information on the replicas, template, and update strategy.
        Status: The current state of the object, including information on its conditions, such as available replicas, and any events related to the object.
    These are the common sections found in most Kubernetes manifest files, but some objects may have additional sections based on their specific requirements. Additionally, some objects may have optional sections or properties, depending on the specific use case. 
 
 
The role of metadata section in Kubernetes Manifest Files :
    In Kubernetes, metadata is information that describes an object, such as a Pod, Service, or Deployment. The metadata provides additional information about the object, such as its name, labels, and annotations.
    Here are some common uses of metadata in Kubernetes:
        Identifying objects: The name of an object is used to identify it within a namespace, and the names must be unique within the namespace.
        Labeling objects: Labels are key-value pairs that can be added to an object's metadata. Labels can be used to organize and identify objects, and to select a set of objects for operations such as scaling, upgrading, or deletion.
        Annotating objects: An annotations are key-value pairs that can be added to an object's metadata. Annotations are used to store non-identifying information about the object, such as information about the object's state or configuration.
        Resource Quotas: Metadata, such as labels, can be used to determine the resources that a particular set of objects can consume, such as CPU, memory, and storage.
        Network policies: Metadata, such as labels, can be used to define network policies that control network access to and from objects.
