Apache Web Server :
    Basic setup commands :
        yum install httpd                             : install apache web server on redhat based distros
        service httpd start                           : start the httpd service
        service httpd status                          : verify httpd status
        service httpd restart                         : restart the httpd service
        firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http   : if a firewall is installed this command allows http trafic
        cat /var/log/httpd/access.log                 : show httpd logs
        cat /var/log/httpd/error.log                  : show httpd error logs
        cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf                : shows the config file
                                                        Some params to edit :
                                                          Listen, DocumentRoot, ServerName
                                                        We can also add multiple websites using VirtualHosts :
                                                          <VirtualHost *:80>
                                                            ServerName www.home.com
                                                            DocumentRoot /var/www/houses
                                                          </VirtualHost>
                                                        We neet to configure the name resolution to access with a servername either by the hosts file or dns config.
                                                        We can also put specific configs for VirtualHosts in separate files and importing them in the main conf file :
                                                           Include conf/home.conf : add this line to httpd.conf to include this conf
                                                        After making any updates to the conf file we need to restart the httpd service
                                                        
Apache tomcat :
    Basic setup commands :
        yum install <java_package>                   : install the java version you want
        wget <link_of_tomcat_package_from_website>   : download the tomcat package from the official website that is compatible with your java version
        ./<tomcat_dir>/bin/startup.sh                : start tomcat server
        cat /<tomcat_dir>/conf/server.xml            : inspect tomcat config (for example changing port by updating <Connector port="8080")
        /<tomcat_dir>/logs                           : the directory of logs
                                                       /<tomcat_dir>/logs/catalina.out :  is the log file for tomcat startup
        /<tomcat_dir>/webapps                        : the directory where to put our apps in war format
                                                       We can generate the war by the jar command in the app dir : jar -cvf app.war *
                                                       We can also use build tools such as maven or gradle : mvn package / gradle build
