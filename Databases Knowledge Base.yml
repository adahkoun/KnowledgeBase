SQL vs NoSql :
  - SQL databases use tables and NoSQL ones use collection
  - In SQL databases we store rows and in NoSQL ones we store documents
  - If we add a column in a SQL databases the whole table will be affected, but in NoSQL only the concerned document is affected.
  - in NoSQL databases documents are generally files with format such as json
  - in NoSQL databases the records are named documents or pages
