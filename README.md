# This is a knowledge base for DevOps Engineers.

As a human, it is normal that I forget some infos, details or commands of various technologies.

Following that fact I decided to make my personal knowledge base so I can help myself remembering some details and in the same time avoiding google searches.

I have also decided to upload these notes in this public repo so everyone can benefit or suggest updates.

I try my best to add new topics whenever I can, so feel free to contribute and help evolving this knowledge base.
