Vagrant Basics :
    Vagrant is tool used to automate the creating and the configuration of VMs
    vagrant init centos/7 : centos/7 is the name of the box we want to initialise (we can find vagrant boxes online)
                            This command initialise the vagrant box in the current directory and creates a Vagrantfile
    vagrant up            : To start a vagrant box, this command download the image required for the VM, then it creates a VM, it gives it a random name and it configures it, then it wait until the machine is booted
                            This command uses VirtualBox provider by defaut, if we work with other providers, we need to force the provider we want with --provider option
    vagrant ssh           : This will SSH into a running Vagrant machine and give you access to a shell.
    
    Common vagrant commands :
        init        : initializes a new Vagrant environment by creating a Vagrantfile
        up          : starts and provisions the vagrant environment
        suspend     : suspends the machine
        resume      : resume a suspended vagrant machine
        halt        : stops the vagrant machine
        destroy     : stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine
        status      : outputs status of the vagrant machine
        reload      : restarts vagrant machine, loads new Vagrantfile configuration
        snapshot    : manages snapshots: saving, restoring, etc.
        
    Example of Vagrantfile :
        # The Vagrantfile syntax is ruby
        # The "2" in the first line above represents the version of the configuration object config that will be used for configuration for that block (the section between the do and the end). 
        # This object can be very different from version to version.
        Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
            config.vm.box = "centos/7"
            # Setting a timeout for VM boot
            config.vm.boot_timeout=600
            # This will allow accessing port 80 on the guest via port 8080 on the host.
            config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
            # The first parameter of synced_folder is a path to a directory on the host machine, 
            # The second parameter must be an absolute path of where to share the folder within the guest machine
            # This folder will be created (recursively, if it must) if it does not exist. By default
            config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"
            # We add configurations of the provider
            config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
                vb.memory = "1024"
                vb.cpus = 2
                vb.name = "my_centos"
            end
            # Provisioners in Vagrant allow you to automatically install software, alter configurations, and more on the machine as part of the vagrant up process.
            config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
                apt-get update
                apt-get install -y apache2
            SHELL
        end
        
    Vagrant providers :
        Vagrant support different providers :
            VirtualBox
            VMware
            Hyper-V
            Docker
--- The provider we want to use in our Vagrantfile should be installed in our host
